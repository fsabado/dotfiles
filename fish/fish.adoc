== fish_plugins for dotfiles

Whenever you install or remove a plugin from the command line, Fisher will write down all the installed plugins to `$__fish_config_dir/fish_plugins`. Adding this file to your dotfiles or version control is the easiest way to share your configuration across different systems.

You can also edit this file and run `fisher update` to commit changes:

[source,bash]
----
nano $__fish_config_dir/fish_plugins

jorgebucaran/fisher
ilancosman/tide@v5
jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
+ PatrickF1/fzf.fish
- /home/jb/path/to/plugin

fisher update

How to set up PATH?::
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26208231/modifying-path-with-fish-shell
[source,bash]
----
# As of fish 3.2.0, released in March 2021, the canonical answer is:

fish_add_path /opt/mycoolthing/bin
Existing answer for fish < 3.2.0:

# The recommended commands for modifying PATH from fish's maintainers are:
# If you want to run the command once:

set -Ua fish_user_paths /path

# If you want to add a command to a startup script, this is idempotent:

contains /path $fish_user_paths; or set -Ua fish_user_paths /path
