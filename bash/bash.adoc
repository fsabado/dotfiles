== Redirection Outputs

.Bash.sh
[source,bash,linenums]
----
`cmd >>file.txt 2>&1`
----

Bash executes the redirects from left to right as follows:

1. `>>file.txt`: Open file.txt in append mode and redirect stdout there.
1. 2>&1: Redirect stderr to "where stdout is currently going". In this case, that is a file opened in append mode. In other words, the &1 reuses the file descriptor which stdout currently uses.
